        <p>
          As administrative and financial operations are essential part of any
          business and while seeing how most of the business owners, overwhelmed
          with their day to day office operations, are in need of additional
          support, we realized that something should be changed. We believed
          they need someone to care their administrative and financial tasks
          with the affordable price. AdminLine was founded with the simple
          mission and lofty objective: to offer Virtual Receptionist,
          Bookkeeping and Call Center support with extraordinary price.

          Every idea starts with a problem. Ours was simple: administrative and
          financial support is expensive. Founder of the company, Monic, face
          the same problem with her family business. They needed someone who
          could help them with those tasks with the affordable price. But
          employing in-house staff was very challenging for a small business and
          she started doing those tasks by herself, working almost 20 hour per
          day. Her core activities and family were left behind and she finally
          decided to find remote support and avoid in-house employment costs.
          After months of searching and interviewing, she finally found a person
          who could cover companies’ administrative tasks with great passion.
